## 🧩 What I Do

I build things that work well *and* look good doing it.  
From delightful mobile apps to battle-tested backends — I design, develop, and ship with care.

- **iOS:** Swift, SwiftUI, CoreData, Firebase  
- **Web:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, GraphQL  
- **Infra:** Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD  
- **Design:** REST APIs, microservices, monorepos, MVVM
